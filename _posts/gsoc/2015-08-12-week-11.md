#Objective

#### Client-Device Logger

##Abstract

Logging momentary Data of a Sensor device using another resource of the same Jid.

##Work

* 2 resources of same device can interact with each other, without any subscription.
* So basic idea is to write a Logging Python Script for SleekXMPP that runs with same Jid as some Sensor Device which keeps asking for its Momentary Data at particular intervals from the Device and stores it locally or in some Database ( InfluxDb ).
* So that when asked for history, the actual resource gives momentary data, while the resource of Logger Script gives History Data.

##Road Ahead

* Complete this module and implement XEP-0326.
* Write Tutorials for all Modules in this Project, made during GSoC 2015.
