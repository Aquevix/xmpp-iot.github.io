#Objective

#### Learning Cordova with Examples

##Abstract

[Apache Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) is a platform for building cross-platform applications using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

This week I have tried various examples in order to have a better understanding of Cordova for the purpose of making an IoT Client application for Android and Apple iOS.

##Work

* Made a starting application that shows a alert message on starting.
* Directory Application that stores the information locally and implement search on it.
* Learn View Routing on Cordova.
* Understand how to use Location, Contacts and Camera APIs using Cordova.

##Images from Example Application

<img src="/images/directory.png" alt="Directory" width="360" />
<img src="/images/employee.png" alt="Employee View" width="360" />

##Road Ahead

* Start with implementation of Application(Login, Strophe Connection, Retrieve Contacts).
