#Objective

#### History Logger for Sensor Devices

##Abstract

Storing momentary data for Sensor Devices by a node that sends back History data stored by the Logger.

##Work

* Implementing IoT_Logger.py for SleekXMPP, which is basically an API for storing and Rerieving of Momentary Data collected from other resource of same device.
* Implementing IoT_HistoryLogger.py for SleekXMPP:
  * It registers a new resource of the same device whose data is to be stored.
  * Sends a read request to the original device at regular intervals and stores the values using above mentioned API.
  * Recieves messages and respond back with history on receiving a history request by getting back data using the above mentioned API.
* Also did a few changes to XEP-0323 Plugin of SleekXMPP for History Messages.

## GSoC Final Evaluation
With this I conclude the modules made in 'Prototyping IoT Tools' Project for GSoC 2015. Will focus a little on Code Clean up and tutorials for the same.
