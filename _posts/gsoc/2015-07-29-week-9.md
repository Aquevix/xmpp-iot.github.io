#Objective

#### VCard, CSS Changes and Read Implementation for Mobile Application

##Abstract

VCard stores the information of a User which is retrieved at the time when the roster is recieved. And Implement Read for Sensor Devices.

##Work

* We use the NickName and Image from the VCard for the Contacts View.
* Bug Fix for Login Form Removal after the connection has been established.
* CSS Changes for the Views.
* Add Dynamic Event Listener for Tap on Contacts to send a Read Request.
* Display Read Values as a Dropdown to the Device in the Contacts View.

##Problems Faced

* (Solved) Dynamic Event Handler was not working when using jQuery on('tap') function. The problem was with the older version of jQuery, replacing it with the latest version solved the problem.

##Final Output

<img src="/images/login2.png" alt="Login View" width="360" />
<img src="/images/contacts2.png" alt="Retrieved Contacts VCard Display" width="360" />
<img src="/images/read-mobile1.png" alt="Read Values of a Device" width="360" />

##Road Ahead

* Implement Write and History using a Graph Library.
* CSS changes for Read Values.
* Some functionality changes for adding contacts to Contacts View.
